/*
    This file is meant as a way to include headings, text and other reusable names across the component. 
    For example, the text for a close button - "Close" - can be put into a const here to be reused across
    the whole component for testing and modularity purposes. 

    You can also put helper functions here to keep things clean in index.tsx and allow for those to be 
    individually tested as well.
